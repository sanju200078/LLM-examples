The main objective of this repository is to experiment with Large Language Models (LLMs) and showcase how they can be applied in different tasks involving text, voice, and user interaction.

File Upload + LLM → Demonstrates how LLMs can read and process uploaded documents. This is useful for summarization, question-answering, and extracting key information.

LLM with FLAN-T5-Large → Shows the power of a Transformer-based model for text transformation, summarization, translation, and reasoning tasks.

Text-to-Voice (Hindi) → Converts generated text into Hindi speech, bridging the gap between language models and real-world communication.

Voice-MP3 with Gradio → Accepts audio input (MP3) and transcribes it into text that can be processed by an LLM. This highlights multimodal interaction (speech → text → model response).

Wiki + LLM → Demonstrates retrieval-based generation, where the LLM processes wiki-style knowledge for summarization and Q&A.

Overall, these examples prove how LLMs can integrate with speech technologies, user interfaces (Gradio), and document handling, making them applicable in education, accessibility, automation, and research.
